# Igo-Cigo.github.io
A simple website made with bootstrap and the help of Github copilot
Some of the features are
* a textarea where you type text
* a input area to change document name
* a button to download the document and to clear it and
* a button to upload a document form local storage

The point of this website was to practice on front end and to test the capabilities of Github copilot
